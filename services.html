                            <p>Look, we get it. Nobody wants to change out their rusty, old strings&dash; it's just a part of life. We've all been there before... hunching over a poorly filmed youtube video of DIY string repair. You try your hardest to replicate what you see one the screen, despite your best efforts it doesn't quite look or sound right. No need to fear, our staff have been replacing strings for years. We charge $20 + the cost of new strings (and tax) for a repair. Book an appointment today!</p>

                            <p>Is your axe collecting dust? Did you know you can clean those things?? We are more than happy to do it for you too! Nothing feels better than having your guitar return to its 'like-new' state! We can clean and polish just about anything&dash; acoustics, electrics, bass guitars, cases, anything really! But we won't clean your car or your house dude. That's up to you. Schedule an appointment online or bring that thing in&dash; walk-ins are always welcome! </p>
